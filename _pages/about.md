I am a current Ph.D. student in Computer Science in [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at New York University. I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Yanjun Han](https://yanjunhan2021.github.io/) and [Zhengyuan Zhou](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~zzhou/index.html). My research is mainly on learning theory, with a particular focus on bandit problems.

In 2021-23, I have been working on Scientific Machine Learning with Benjamin Peherstorfer. Prior to that, I received my B.A. in Math and in CS at New York University.

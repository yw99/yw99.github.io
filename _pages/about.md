I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science in [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at New York University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yanjun Han](https://yanjunhan2021.github.io/) and Prof. [Zhengyuan Zhou](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~zzhou/index.html). My research is mainly on learning theory, with a particular focus on bandit problems.

In 2021-23, I have been working on Scientific Machine Learning with Prof. Benjamin Peherstorfer. Prior to that, I received my B.A.s in Math and in CS at New York University and graduated with latin honor and department award (cf. my [CV](/assets/pdf/Curriculum_Vitae_Yuxiao_Wen.pdf)).

More about myself: I (fortunately) have the most lovely cat in the world. I love anything with matcha. My favorite anime/manga are (alphabetical order) *Ajin*, *Alice in Borderland*, *Fire Punch*, *Jojo 2-4*, *The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.*, and tons of others.
